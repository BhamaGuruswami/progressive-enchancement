                <p> Up in space, turning around, looking at the earth’s face. From that rock’s perspective on Mars or
                    that
                    gaz
                    opinion from Jupiter, nothing cares about your problems. Up
                    there, it’s just not serious, and there’s no such thing as an issue.

                    Down here, the only reality is the one inside our brain. Nothing exists if the brain doesn’t think
                    it. Nothing exists neither if our senses don’t transmit the message. That means that if we mis
                    sense, our reality changes. That’s possible because our perception is limited : you can’t see at 360
                    degrees for example. If we mis translate the message, our reality changes. If we think it in a way,
                    our reality changes depending on that way. Therefore, if we can change reality that much,
                    everything’s fake.

                    They’re proofs to that. Fall in love with someone and you’ll see that person as divine. Pull
                    yourself out of that grip and the divine falls from clouds to solid ground, revealing him or herself
                    differently. But the person is the same, you just changed your mind. Everything works like that :
                    it’s not just that you can make your world, it’s that you passively do it anyway.

            <article>
                <p> Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors
                    came
                    around to
                    commiserate. They said, “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”
                    The
                    farmer said,
                    “Is it <strong class="good">good</strong>? Is it <strong class="bad">bad</strong>? I don't know.”
                    The
                    next day
                    the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it,
                    and in the
                    evening everybody came back and said, “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now
                    have
                    eight
                    horses!”
                    The farmer again said, “Is it <strong class="good">good</strong>? Is it <strong
                        class="bad">bad</strong>? I
                    don't know.”
            </article>
            </p>

            <p> The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke
                his
                leg. The
                neighbors then said, <q>Oh dear, that’s too <strong class="bad">bad</strong>,</q> and the farmer
                responded,
                <q>Is it <strong class="good">good</strong>? Is it <strong class="bad">bad</strong>? I don't
                    know.</q> The
                next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his
                son
                because he
                had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q>Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said,
                “Is
                it
                <strong class="good">good</strong>? Is it

                <strong class="bad">bad</strong>? I don't know.
            </p>

            <p> The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible
                to
                tell whether
                anything that happens in it is <strong class="good">good</strong> or <strong class="bad">bad</strong> —
                because
                you never know what will be the consequence of the
                misfortune; or,
                you never know what will be the consequences of <strong class="good">good</strong> fortune.</p>

        <h1> Conclusion</h1>
        <p><q class="quote1"> <strong class="good">good</strong> and <strong class="bad">bad</strong> are just one
                perspective. Bananas are
                <strong class="good">good</strong> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <strong class="good">good</strong>
                for
                bananas.

                make a big deal out of it...</q>
